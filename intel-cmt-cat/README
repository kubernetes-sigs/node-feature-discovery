Overview
========

This software package provides basic support for
Intel(R) Resource Director Technology (Intel(R) RDT) including:
Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT), Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM),
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT), Code and Data Prioritization (CDP)
and Memory Bandwidth Allocation (MBA).

In principle, the software programs the technologies via
Model Specific Registers (MSR) on a hardware thread basis.
MSR access is arranged via a standard operating system driver:
msr on Linux and cpuctl on FreeBSD. In the most common architectural
implementations, presence of the technologies is detected via the
CPUID instruction.

In a limited number of special cases where CAT is not architecturally
supported on a particular SKU (but instead a non-architectural
(model-specific) implementation exists) it can be detected via brand
string. This brand string is read from CPUID and compared to a table
of known-supported SKUs. If needed, a final check is to probe the
specific MSR’s to discover hardware capabilities, however it is
recommended that CPUID enumeration should be used wherever possible.

From software version v1.0.0 the library adds option to use Intel(R) RDT via
available OS interfaces (perf and resctrl on Linux). The library detects
presence of these interfaces and allows to select the preferred one through
a configuration option.
As the result, existing tools like 'pqos' or 'rdtset' can also be used
to manage Intel(R) RDT in an OS compatible way. MSR interface remains
the default option for now. 'pqos' tool wrappers have been added to help with
the interface selection. 'pqos-os' and 'pqos-msr' for OS and MSR interface
operations respectively.

PID API compile time option has been removed and the APIs are always available.
Note that proper operation of these APIs depends on availability and
selection of OS interface.

Software Compatibility
======================

In short, use intel-cmt-cat or Intel(R) PCM software together with
Linux perf and cgroup frameworks is not allowed at the moment.

As disappointing as it is, use of Linux perf for CMT & MBM and
intel-cmt-cat for CAT & CDP is not allowed. This is because
Linux perf overrides existing CAT configuration during its operations.

There are a number of options to choose from in order to make use of CAT:
- intel-cmt-cat software for CMT/MBM/CAT and CDP (core granularity only)
- use Linux resctrl for CAT and Linux perf for monitoring (kernel 4.10+)
- patch kernel with an out of tree cgroup patch (CAT) and
  only use perf for monitoring (CMT kernels 4.1+, MBM kernels 4.6+)

References:
(1) pqos monitoring from intel-cmt-cat can detect other
    pqos monitoring processes in the system.
    rdtset from intel-cmt-cat detects other processes started with rdtset and
    it will not use their CAT/CDP resources.

(2) pqos from intel-cmt-cat can detect that Intel(R) PCM monitors cores and
    it will not attempt to hijack the cores unless forced.
    However, if pqos monitoring is started first and then
    Intel(R) PCM is started then the latter one will hijack monitoring
    infrastructure from pqos for its use.

(3) Linux cgroup is an out of tree patch

(4) Linux kernel version 4.10 and newer.
    A wiki for Intel resctrl is available at:

(5) Only with Linux kernel version 4.10 (and newer),
    intel-cmt-cat version 1.0.0 (and newer) with selected OS interface
