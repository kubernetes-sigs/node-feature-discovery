.SH NAME
pqos, pqos-msr, pqos-os \- Intel(R) Resource Director Technology monitoring and control tool
.br
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pqos
.RI [ OPTIONS ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Intel(R) Resource Director Technology is designed to monitor and manage cpu
resources and improve performance of applications and virtual machines.
.PP
Intel(R) Resource Director Technology includes monitoring and control
technologies. Monitoring technologies include CMT (Cache Monitoring Technology),
which monitors occupancy of last level cache, and MBM (Memory Bandwidth Monitoring).
Control technologies include CAT (Cache Allocation Technology) and CDP (Code Data
Prioritization).
.PP
pqos supports CMT and MBM on a per core or hardware thread basis. MBM supports
two types of events reporting local and remote memory bandwidth.
.br
pqos-msr and pqos-os are simple pqos wrapper scripts that automatically select
the MSR or OS/Kernel library interface to program the technologies.
.br
Please see the -I option below for more information.
.PP
For hardware information please refer to the README located on:

.TP
.B \-f FILE, \-\-config\-file=FILE

.TP
.B \-e CLASSDEF, \-\-alloc\-class=CLASSDEF
define the allocation classes on all CPU sockets. CLASSDEF format is "TYPE:ID=DEFINITION;...".
.br
define classes for selected CPU resources. CLASSDEF format is "TYPE[@RESOURCE_ID]:ID=DEFINITION;...".
.br
For CAT, TYPE is "llc" for the last level cache (aka l3) and "l2" for level 2 cache, ID is a CLOS number and DEFINITION is a bitmask.
.br
For MBA, TYPE is "mba", ID is a CLOS number and DEFINITION is a value between 1 and 100 representing the percentage of available memory bandwidth.
.br
RESOURCE_ID is a unique number that can represent a socket or l2/l3 cache identifier. The RESOURCE_ID for each logical CPU can be found using "pqos -s"
.br
.B Note: When CDP is on, ID can be postfixed with 'D' for data or 'C' for code. CDP is not available for l2.
.br
Some examples:
.RS
.RS
"\-e llc:0=0xffff;llc:1=0x00ff;llc@0-1:2=0xff00;l2:2=0x3f;l2@2:1=0xf"
.br
"\-e llc:0d=0xfff;llc:0c=0xfff00"
.br
"\-e mba:1=30;mba@1:3=80"
.RE
.RE
.br
.RS
Note:
.RS
.br
"\-e l2:2=0x3f" means that COS2 for all L2 cache clusters is changed to 0x3f.
.br
"\-e l2@2:1=0xf" means that COS1 for L2 cache cluster 2 is changed to 0xf.
.br
"\-e mba:1=30" means that COS1, on all sockets, can utilize up to 30% of available memory bandwidth.
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \-a CLASS2ID, \-\-alloc\-assoc=CLASS2ID
associate allocation classes with cores. CLASS2ID format is "TYPE:ID=CORE_LIST;..." or "TYPE:ID=TASK_LIST;...".
.br
For CAT, TYPE is "llc", "core" or "pid" and ID is a class number. CORE_LIST is comma or dash separated list of cores. TASK_LIST is comma or dash separated list of process/task ID's.
.br
For example:
.RS
.RS
.br
"\-a llc:0=0,2,4,6-10;llc:1=1;" associates cores 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 with CAT class 0 and core 1 with class 1.
.br
"\-a core:0=0,2,4,6-10;core:1=1;" associates cores 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 with CAT class 0 and core 1 with class 1.
.br
"\-I \-a pid:0=3543,7643,4556;pid:1=7644;" associates process ID 3543, 7643, 4556 with CAT class 0 and process ID 7644 with class 1.
.RE
.br
Note:
.RS
.br
The \-I option must be used for PID association.
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \-R [CONFIG], \-\-alloc\-reset[=CONFIG]
reset allocation setting (L3 CAT, L2 CAT) and reconfigure L3 CDP. CONFIG is one of the following options:
.br
l3cdp-on	sets L3 CDP on
.br
l3cdp-off	sets L3 CDP off
.br
l3cdp-any	keep current L3 CDP setting (default)
.TP
.B \-m EVTCORES, \-\-mon\-core=EVTCORES
select the cores and events for monitoring, EVTCORES format is "EVENT:CORE_LIST". Valid EVENT settings are:
.br
\- "llc" for CMT (LLC occupancy)
.br
\- "mbr" for MBR (remote memory bandwidth)
.br
\- "mbl" for MBL (local memory bandwidth)
.br

.br
Core statistics can be grouped by enclosing the core list in square brackets.

.TP
.B \-p [EVTPIDS], \-\-mon-pid[=EVTPIDS]

.SH NOTES
.PP
CMT, MBM and CAT are configured using Model Specific Registers (MSRs). The pqos software
executes in user space, and access to the MSRs is obtained through a standard Linux*
interface. The msr file interface is protected and requires root privileges.
The msr driver might not be auto-loaded and on some modular kernels the driver may
need to be loaded manually:
.PP
For Linux:
.br
sudo modprobe msr
.PP
For FreeBSD:
.br
sudo kldload cpuctl
.PP
.PP
Interface enforcement:
.br
If you require system wide interface enforcement you can do so by setting the "RDT_IFACE" environment variable.
